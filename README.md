# 👋 Welcome

Hi, I’m **mis4nthr0pia**, a full stack web developer, cybersecurity enthusiast, and computer science student based in the Philippines.

This GitBook contains my **UofTCTF 2026 writeups**, where I document how I approach challenges, break down vulnerabilities, and connect them to real-world security concepts. These notes serve both as a personal knowledge base and as a way to give back to the CTF and infosec community.

I’m especially interested in **web security, offensive security, and exploitation techniques**, and I enjoy challenges that look simple on the surface but require deeper technical understanding once you start digging.

One of the most challenging and memorable problems for me was **No Quotes 3** — a task that pushed me to think creatively around strict input constraints, payload crafting, and edge-case behavior. It was a great reminder that limitations often force better exploitation strategies.

## 🛠 Technical Background

Alongside CTFs, I have a strong programming background, which I actively use when solving challenges:

- **Languages:** PHP, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks & Patterns:** Django, MVC-based architectures  
- **Tools & Practices:** Linux, scripting, automation, basic pentesting workflows

This mix of **development and security** helps me understand both how systems are built and how they break — which is a perspective I try to reflect in every writeup.
